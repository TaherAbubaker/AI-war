# ⚔️ AI WAR — The Front-End Battles

Welcome to **AI WAR** — where I put AI coding assistants to the ultimate test.  
No mercy, no bias — only results.  
Each challenge was given to ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, and others like LLaMA and Copilot.  
The mission: **Who can build the cleanest, most complete front-end project**?

🧠 *All scores are based on creativity, usability, code quality, UI, and working features.*

## 🧪 BATTLE 1 — Responsive Website (MVP Style)

**Competitors:** ChatGPT 🧠 vs DeepSeek 🤖 vs LLaMA 🦙 vs Copilot 🧑‍💻  
**Challenge:** Build a full MVP-style website with HTML + CSS + JS + Bootstrap.

### 💥 Results:

- **🧠 ChatGPT:** 4/5  
  > Clean and real-life-like site. Solid hit. Felt usable and structured, but UI wasn’t as modern as DeepSeek’s.  

- **🤖 DeepSeek:** **🔥 5/5**  
  > Didn’t expect it... but it’s one of the most professional sites I’ve ever seen. UI clean. Layout solid. Took the W.  

- **🦙 LLaMA:** 1/5  
  > Honestly disappointing. Has potential, but this wasn’t it.  

- **🧑‍💻 Copilot:** 0/5  
  > Completely failed. Broken HTML. Missing logic. MVP? More like MIA.
